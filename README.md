# PythonRevision
### Doing code wars practice to remind me of python syntax and operators.

## Task 1
A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless it is the first word, which is always capitalised.

Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will be given as a string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore the case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string is changed.

## Task 2
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

## Task 3
You are given two positive integers a and b (a < b <= 20000). Complete the function which returns a list of all those numbers in the interval [a, b) whose digits are made up of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) but which are not primes themselves.

## Task 4
Given two integers m, n (1 <= m <= n) we want to find all integers between m and n whose sum of squared divisors is itself a square. 42 is such a number.

The result will be an array of arrays or of tuples (in C an array of Pair) or a string, each subarray having two elements, first the number whose squared divisors is a square and then the sum of the squared divisors.
